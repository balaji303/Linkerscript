Linker does 3 things
1. RESOLVE SYMBOLS/ADDRESS
2. MERGE SECTIONS (Need script)
3. PLACEMENT OF SECTIONS (Need script)
If there is a global value named as int app=3 and this happens in a.c file,
A file called b.c, uses the app inside its function. Now during the assembler stage,
it says I dont know the address of the app variable, I will leave a hole here
for the linker. During the linker stage, the linker scritches the hole with
a.c file. This is what ~~~~~RESOLVE SYMBOLS/ADDRESS~~~~~

If there is code, there is data. The data can be of different forms,
    1. global,
        1.1. Unintialised,
        1.2. Initialised.
    2. local,
        2.1. Unintialised,
        2.2. Initialised.
    3. static.

These datas will be stored in blocks
    1. .txt -> Has the code
    2. .bss -> Has the Unintialised variables
    3. .data -> Has the Intialised variables
    4. .rodata -> Initialised read only i.e., Const datas
This will be there for ever .o file, Linker merges all these sections into one file.
This is ~~~~~MERGE SECTIONS~~~~~

After the single file is created, we can place these sections anywhere in MCU,
like internal SRAM, RAM, ROM. This process is ~~~~~PLACEMENT OF SECTIONS~~~~~

Commands used:
1. arm-none-eabi-gcc -c main.c
Used to create .o file using .c file
2. arm-none-eabi-gcc -c bar.c
Used to create .o file using .c file
3. arm-none-eabi-objdump -D main.o
Used to print assembly the contents of .o file
4. arm-none-eabi-objdump -D main.o > main.s
Used to create .s file using the contents of .o file, even .txt works instead of .s
5. arm-none-eabi-objdump -D bar.o > bar.s
Used to create .s file using the contents of .o file, even .txt works instead of .s
6. arm-none-eabi-ld main.o bar.o -o main.elf
Link and create elf file using .o files
7. arm-none-eabi-objdump -D main.elf > main.elf.s
Create a .s version of the elf file, so we can view in the txt editor
8. arm-none-eabi-ld --verbose
To view the default linker script text
9. arm-none-eabi-ld --verbose > DefaultLinker.txt
To create a txt file with the contents of default linker

Create 2 .c files and do the above steps/Commands
Once you completed upto step 5, we can see that .text and other sections are separated
and at line 11 of aaa.txt file, there is bl 0, now we dont know the
address of the function fun_retn, even the value of x is unknown at line 22.
One thing to observe is both the function starts at 0x000 which is wrong.
Value of X in line 18 at bbb.txt file is 0x0 which is wrong
While doing the step 6 we get a warning that as per default,
we are starting at 0x8000. Check the default linker file to know more, at line 19.
Since we cant see the contents of elf file we create a txt version of it.
Do step 7.
To view the default linker do step 8 and 9

--------- Video 8 ---------
Create a c program with different kind of variables.

Commands used:
1. arm-none-eabi-gcc -c main.c
Used to create .o file using .c file
2. arm-none-eabi-objdump -D main.o
Used to print assembly the contents of .o file
3. arm-none-eabi-objdump -D main.o > main.s
Used to create .s file using the contents of .o file, even .txt works instead of .s
4. arm-none-eabi-ld main.o -o main.elf
Link and create elf file using .o files
5. arm-none-eabi-objdump -D main.elf > main.elf.s
Create a .s version of the elf file, so we can view in the txt editor

--------- Video 9 ---------
Repeat all the steps that are done in Video8
0. arm-none-eabi-
Prints all subcommmands
1. arm-none-eabi-nm --help
Prints the help Commands
2. arm-none-eabi-nm main.elf
Prints all symbol in main.elf
3. arm-none-eabi-objdump -D main.elf

4. arm-none-eabi-objdump -f main.elf
dumps the file header
5. arm-none-eabi-readelf -a main.elf
Prints all the contents of elf file with header and body

Elf stands for Executable and Linkable file format
********************* 1 End *********************
******************* Section 2 *******************
--------- Video 13 ---------
For every file there is
    1. .data -> Collection of Initialised data
    2. .bss  -> Collection of Unintialised data
    3. .text -> Collection of code here foo function
Consider this is a memory block, whose start address is 0xA000
 and length is 0x1000
0xA000 - -----
         |   |
         |   |
         |   |
0x1000 - -----

Inside memory Banks:
    SOME_NAME : ORIGIN = 0XA000 , LENGTH = 0x1000
This is the syntax for the memory region where,
    ORIGIN is the starting address of the region and
    LENGTH is the length of the region
    SEMICOLN is not required

For memory,
    MEMORY { ***here goes the line 119*** }

In Section A of video13, the make file optimzies because the function in source code, no one calls the function.
In Sec B of the video13, the make file optimzies is removed
In Sec C of the video13, each sections goe to respective section, i.e., the .data goes to .data and like wise
In Sec D of the video13, instead of SOME_NAME in linker I used balaji
--------- Video 15 ---------
Take make file from video13/B section
In section A, Create a new file side.c and update the make file to make side.c also.
we did not say liker to link side.o's content like .bss, .data and .text but its there in map file
In section B, we extern the variables from side file to the main file. but even now we are not saying
the linker to link side.o's content but its there in map file
In section C, we have update the linker to discard the side.o file sections but if er run this we get
erros that some sections are not found, next video is about solving this error.
--------- Video 17 ---------
Copy Paste everything from 15Video/A
Update the Linker so as to
Keep the data sections of both file together
Keep the bss section of both file together
Keep the text section of both file together
And discard the other section such as arm and comment sections in side
But the same other sections of main are considered
--------- Video 18 ---------
Copy Paste everything from 17Video/
We already discard the other section such as arm and comment sections in side and also main
now main's other section are also discarded
--------- Video 20 ---------
Copy Paste everything from 18Video/
In LinkerScript use * which is common for both main and side file
********************* 2 End *********************
******************* Section 3 *******************
--------- Video 21 ---------
In section A, Copy Paste everything from 20Video/
Create a new variable with Initialised value in side.c file and compile, the variable appeats
in .data section
In section B, rename the new variable to const and compile, the variable is discarded
This is because const variables go to .rodata section
In section C, the ld file is modified to move rodata to new .rodata section
RAM section is where we have stored all the memory section as of now,
but when we do a power cycle in the embedded device the contents of RAM is erased.
So we need to store the memory sections in ROM, here too we have a problem, ROM is slow
To address both the issues, we need to separated the memory sections into two different
regions,
ROM -> .text and .rodata
RAM -> .data and .bss
--------- Video 23 ---------
Copy Section 21Video/C and use it for 23Video
Created a new memory section ROM and divided the sections
as per
ROM -> .text and .rodata
RAM -> .data and .bss
Now, const is stored in ROM
--------- Video 24 ---------
Copy section 23Video, and use it for this
If .data is preset in RAM,during an ongoing calculation power fails,
The .data is erased and calculation must happen from first.
To solve this problem, we can store everything in ROM but its slow.
Another way is to store/Load/logical in ROM and have Virtual address
access RAM.
LMA -> Load Memory Address
VMA -> Virtual Memory Address

VMA AT > LMA this is the syntax

Although we added AT > ROM in .data section, .bss section is also moved
Copy section 24Video/A and use it here,
To avoid the movement of .bss section, we have updated the linker
by adding AT > RAM to it.
Copy section 24Video/B and use it here for C.
Since we may not make sure 100% of what moves where, we need to use
VMA AT > LMA syntax for all which is the best practice.
--------- Video 25 ---------
As always copy the contents of the previous lession/video 24vIDEO/C
Now we are going to create a variable and assign a value to it.
Creating variable are more simple than creating a variable in c
The . operator is used to get the addres of the current location of the
cursor

Using the dot operator we can get the start and stop of any perticulat section
Check the linker and map files
--------- Video 26 ---------
copy the contents of the previous lession/video 25VIDEO
We all know that the sections are placed in the respective memory region
in an order as we specfy in the linker
i.e., 1. text data (ROM alone)
2. .rodata (ROM alone)
3. .data (RAM and ROM)
4. .bss (RAM alone)
Check the linker and map file
--------- Video 27 ---------
copy the contents of the previous lession/video 26VIDEO
We are going to extern the linker variables to c's source file
and access those variables


We are going create a function that can
manually or programatically copy the contents
of ROM to RAM using linker variables and access them

But we need to make sure this function is called at first
before the other functions and also Initialised bss sections to
zero complelety

--------- Video 28 ---------
In section A, Creating a separate section for the function customBalaji()
in map file that sections is discarded, because we mentioned in linker script
to discard sections that are not related  to .text or .data or .bss and .rodata

In section B, Linker's .text is updated to have secBalaji sections

In section C, A new section is created to have secBalaji

void __attribute__(( section("secBalaji"))) customBalaji(void)
The weird thing in the above line is called GCC attribute
or compiler attribute

******************* Section 4 *******************
--------- Video 30 ---------
Linker Command Language
1. Input Files
2. Output Files
3. File format of Input and Output files
4. Address of memory sections
5. Placemenet of sections

Above are the five points that linker will understand
--------- Video 31 ---------
LinkerScript are nothing but just a Collection of statements

This section is preset in the command that is used to trigger
the linker ----
These statements are used to
    1. select files,
    2. Group the files or linking the files,
    3. Name the Output file

This section is preset inside the linker
Two statements that plays a vital role of grouping the files are
    1. Memory
    2. Section
--------- Video 32 ---------
Experssions
- All values are considered as either signed long intergers or unsigned long intergers,
- All constants are intergers,
- All C arithmetic operations are published,
- We can reference or define and create global variables,
- We can call specific inbuild functions,
we can create variable and assign them values in hex
WE can also do arithmetic calculations using the variables
--------- Video 33 ---------
Values
- Intergers
    - Negative
    - Hex
    - Decimal
    - Octal
- Suffixes like:
    - k -> 10^3 i.e., instead of 1000, k can be used
    - M -> 10^6 i.e., instead of 1000000, M can be used
    - Maybe used to scale a constant
--------- Video 34 ---------
Symbol names
- If not quoted, then symbol names should start with
    - letter
    - underscore
    - point
- If not quoted we need to make sure they have no conflit with
    any keywords
    - "SECTIONS" = RAM -> This is valid
    - SECTIONS = RAM -> This is invalid
- May include any letters, underscores, digits, points
    ans hypens
--------- Video 35 ---------
Location Counter ---
- (.) dot is called the location Counter
- Always contains the current output location
- It always appears in the section command
- Appears anywhere an ordinary symbol is allowed in an Experssions
- Assignment to dot operator has an side effect
    - This moves the location Counter
    - Can be used to create holes in the output section
- Should never be moved in backwards
--------- Video 36 ---------

Expression Evaluation ---
- "Lazy evalution" is used for expressions.
    - Calculates an expression when absolutely necessary.
- Needs the start address and the length of memory regions, in order to do any linking
    - These values are coputed as soon as the command file is read
- Values like - "symbol values" are not known until after storage allocation

--------- Video 37 ---------
Assignment operator ---
Assignment : Defining SYMBOLS

    Symbol  = expression;
    Symbol &= expression;
    Symbol += expression;
    Symbol -= expression;
    Symbol *= expression;
    Symbol /= expression;

- TWO  things distinguish assignments from other operatos in linkerscript expressions
    - Assignment may only be used at the root of an expression
        a = b+3 -> This is allowed
        a + b = 3 -> This is not allowed
    - You may place a trailing semicoln at the end of an Assignment statements
--------- Video 38 ---------
Assignment statements placement ---

Assignment statements may appear
1. As commands in their own right in an linker script or
    1. Define a symbol with an absolute address
2. As independent statements within a sections command or
3. As part of the contents of section definition in a sections command
    1. Defines a symbol whose address is relative to a particular section
4. When a linker expression is evaluated and assigned to a variable, it is given either an absolute
or a relocatable type
    - The value is same as it will be in the output file
    - The value is a fixed offset from the base of the section
5. Type of expression is controlled by"
	- Position in the script file
		- Relocatable -> Fixed offset from the secion, relative to base of section.
		- Absolute -> Anywhere else, it is created as an absolute value.
				Even when assigned within the section using ABSOLUTE() function
		- PROVIDE -> Used to define a symbol. The syntax is PROVIDE (symbol = expression)
Arithmetic Functions ---
- ABSOLUTE(expr) -> Returns absolure, non-relocatable value of expression expr
- ADDR (section) -> Returns absolute address of named section.
- LOADADDR(section) -> Returns absolure load address of the named section.
- AUGN(expr) -> Returns the result of the current location counter (.) alinged to the next exp boundary
	- Must be an expression whose value is a power of 2
- DEFINED(symbol) -> Returns 1 if symbol is in the linker global symbol table and defined,
	Example: begin = DEFINED(begin)? begin: . ;
- NEXT(expr) -> Return the next unallocated address that is multiple of exp
	- closely related to AUGN(exp) command,
	- unless you use the memory command to define discontinous memory for the output file, the two functions are equivalent
- SIZEOF(section) -> Returns size in bytes of the named section.
